**ConnectIn** is a dynamic web platform designed to bridge the gap between developers seeking practical experience and projects/teams looking for motivated talent. It serves as a comprehensive ecosystem fostering collaboration, skill development, and career growth within the IT community, initially focused on the Kazakhstan tech scene but built with global potential.

## 🎯 The Problem

Many aspiring developers, students, and even experienced professionals face significant hurdles:

* **Finding Relevant Experience:** Difficulty securing initial roles or projects due to a lack of demonstrable, real-world experience.
* **Discovering Opportunities:** Traditional job boards often lack context about project specifics or team dynamics. Platforms like GitHub are code-centric, missing tools for holistic team formation and project management.
* **Building a Network:** Finding collaborators, mentors, or like-minded peers for projects can be challenging.
* **Showcasing Practical Skills:** Resumes often fail to capture true collaborative abilities and hands-on project contributions.

## ✨ The Solution: ConnectIn

ConnectIn tackles these challenges by providing an integrated platform where:

* **Developers** can build rich profiles showcasing their skills, education, *and* contributions to **real projects** hosted on the platform. They can easily discover projects matching their interests and apply to join teams.
* **Team Leaders & Initiators** can create detailed project pages, specify required skills and roles, and recruit motivated team members based on their profiles and demonstrated abilities.
* **Companies & HR** can identify potential candidates by observing their practical skills, teamwork within projects, and verified contributions, going beyond traditional resumes.
* **The Community** can share knowledge, insights, and project updates through posts, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## 🔑 Key Features

* 👤 **Rich User Profiles:** Detail skills, experience, education, projects participated in, social links, and status.
* 🚀 **Project Hub:** Create, discover, and manage projects with descriptions, required skills, team members, and progress tracking (future).
* 🤝 **Team Formation:** Build teams, invite members, and manage collaboration within projects.
* 📝 **Post & News Feed:** Share updates, articles, questions, and insights with the community. Engage with likes and comments.
* 💬 **Real-Time Chat:** Integrated chat for direct messaging and potentially team/project communication (with media sharing via S3).
* 🧠 **ML-Powered Recommendations:**
    * **Content-Based:** Recommends relevant projects and teams based on user skill similarity.
    * **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends posts based on user interaction patterns (likes).
* 📄 **AI Resume Generation (Optional Add-on):** Generate professional resumes based on user profile data.
* ☁️ **Cloud Integration:** Leverages AWS services (RDS, S3, Lambda, ECR, EventBridge) for database management, file storage, and scalable ML task execution.

Frontend (React on Vercel): Provides the user interface, interacts with the backend API.Backend (FastAPI on Railway): A monolithic API handling core business logic, user authentication, data management (via RDS), file uploads (via S3), and WebSocket communication for the chat.ML Service (Python on AWS Lambda): An independent, serverless function triggered by EventBridge. It reads data from RDS, calculates recommendations using ML algorithms, and writes results back to RDS, minimizing load on the main backend. It's deployed as a Docker container via ECR.AWS Services: RDS for the database, S3 for file storage, ECR for the ML service's Docker image, Lambda for serverless ML execution, EventBridge for scheduling, IAM for permissions, and CloudWatch for monitoring.🚀 Getting StartedFollow these instructions to set up the project locally for development.Prerequisites:Python 3.11+Node.js and npm/yarnDocker & Docker Compose (Recommended for local DB/Redis)PostgreSQL database (local instance or connection string to a test instance)AWS Account & configured AWS CLI (Optional, for testing S3/ML parts locally against AWS)GitSetup:Clone the Repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
